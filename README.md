# SonoPlay SM6

This is a fork of SonoPlay for Cambridge Audio Stream Magic 6. It supports the SM6's specific requirements regarding controls and playback management, particularly for features related to Reciva radio and remote control.

Thank you to aquantumofdonuts for maintaining SonoPlay and to songchenwen for creating the original version of Plex DLNA Player.

## What It Does

Plexamp cannot natively cast to DLNA/UPnP targets. SonoPlay exposes your DLNA devices as Plex players so they appear in Plexamp's cast list.

Data path:

```text
Plexamp -> SonoPlay -> DLNA/UPnP speaker
```

## Key Features

- DLNA/UPnP device discovery
- Plex device registration via Plex.tv link flow
- Playback command translation (play, pause, seek, queue navigation)
- Virtual device groups for multi-room playback
- Web UI for linking and device management
- Docker-first deployment

## Quick Start

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name sonoplay \
  --network host \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -v /path/to/config:/config \
  ghcr.io/aquantumofdonuts/sonoplay:latest
```

### Docker Compose

```bash
git clone --branch stable https://github.com/aquantumofdonuts/sonoplay.git
cd sonoplay
docker compose up -d
```

### First Use

1. Open http://your-server:32488
2. Link one or more devices to Plex
3. In Plexamp, open cast targets and select the linked device

## Configuration

Most installs work with defaults. To customize:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Common settings:

- HTTP_PORT: Web UI/API port (default 32488)
- HOST_IP: Explicit host IP (auto-detected when unset)
- CLIENT_PROFILE: Plex transcoding profile

Note: docker-compose.yaml uses env_file.required and needs Docker Compose v2.17+.

## Requirements

- Docker (preferred) or Python 3.11+
- Plex Media Server on the same network
- Plex Pass for Plexamp
- DLNA/UPnP MediaRenderer-compatible targets

## Supported Devices

Any standards-compliant DLNA/UPnP renderer, including common Sonos, Yamaha, Denon/Marantz, and smart TV implementations.
